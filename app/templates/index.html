If so, knowing which part of the game best predicts success could help you!<br><br>Our team leveraged 22 performance statistics from 2017-2021 and multiple machine learning models to conduct extensive quantiative analyses, the goal of which was to identify which stats best predict a PGA Tour golfer's annual winnings.<br><br>Using the interactive chart below, explore the statistics that demonstrate a strong relationship with the ultimate output - annual winnings!  Hover over each data point to see which golfers separated themselves from the field over the last five seasons.</h3>

        <h3>Winnings are the ultimate measure of success for a professional golfer.  Given that purses (the winnings offered by each tournament) increase with the profile of the tournament and the corresponding level of competition, it is reasonable to assume that the best golfers will earn the highest winnings.</h3>
        <h3>The average PGA Tour golfer earned approximately $2 million between 2017 and 2021, although more than half of the golfers earned less than $1.55 million per year.</h3>

            <h3>The primary outout of our analysis was the ranked importance of key golf statistics.  Leveraging multiple supervised learning models, we were able to isolate a handful of performance statistics that predicted a golfer's success.</h3>  
            <h3>Not surprisingly, the Strokes Gained statistics were the highest performers in our models.  These statistics evaluate golers' performance relative to the field.  In a competitive setting, outperforming your competition will obviously lead to imporved results.</h3>
            <h3>When ranking each of these statitsics, the Strokes Gained - Approach the Green rose above the rest.  This is a measure of a golfer's relative performance when they approaching the green from a distance greater than 50 yards, a component of the golf game that is pivotal to their overall success - a good shot results in an easy putt while a bad shot lands further from the green, potentially costing multiple strokes.</h3>

Removing Strokes Gained Tee to Green and Birdie to Bogey ratio stats (highly-correlated independent variables) improved the model.
