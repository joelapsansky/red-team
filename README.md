# Red Team Project

## Selected topic
Reason for selecting topic:  The team is interested in sports analytics, and PGA data has friendly terms and a wide-array of available data to analyze.  
Description of source data:  pgatour.com
Question to answer:  Which specific statistics collected on professional golfers contribute most to overall winnings since the start of 2017?
Audience: Media, news outlets, fans, and player support groups (e.g. caddies, coaches, etc.) with specific interests in players' successes.

## Description of the communication protocols
Our team has opted to exclusively use slack for communication, but we will add other channels if we find that it is necessary.  
  
Segment 1 Github plan: 4 branches (one for each team member) with feature names and at least 4 commits for each team member

## Technologies Used
### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Our team used Pandas to scrape and clean the data.  We used the "to_csv" function to send our cleaned dataset to a CSV for everyone to use.

### Database Storage
Our team intends to use Mongo db.  We will use Flask to display the data.  In segment one, we spent a lot of time scraping and gathering Machine Learning code.  We intend to make more progress with the Flask app in segment two.

### Machine Learning
We plan to use an unsupervised machine learning model for our project.  Caroline has started re-reviewing the crypto currency unit as a refresher as our project will draw on very similar code to help us identify the main drivers behind PGA tour money winnings.

### Dashboard
Our team will use a Flask template in conjunction with D3 in order to create an interactive dashboard.  We are still discussing how to host it.
